Color palettes for Apple II

Each file contains 16 colors in RGB+A format (alpha byte is ignored and can be left at 00)
The palettes have been split in two folder:

* Realistic 	
Palettes attempting to replicate exact standard Apple II colors, or slight variatiosns of them (similar colors)
(note that there is more than one "standard" set of colors since there was many different color hardware duign the Apple II lifespace)

* Fantasy 
These are very different than standard colors, and will give your display a very different feel.

For example, a "realistic CGA" palette would try to use colors similar to the Apple II,
using 6 colors in hi-res mode (black, white, orange, blue, green, purple).

But a "fantasy CGA" palette will attempt to make the screen look like a PC CGA using a mix of 4 colors (red, green, yellow, black).
